# Favorites

I personally love movies and it's hard to pick which one is my favorite overall but I am going to have to go with Quentin Tarantino's "Once Upon a Time in Hollywood". I will leave a link to the poster to this film.

I am also into American Realistic art. I have always been facinated by it as it is basically putting a mirror up to American society and essentially showing us how we are as Americans. But in that area, I have always been mesmerized by Nighthawks by Edward Hopper. I will leave a link for you to have a look for yourself.
